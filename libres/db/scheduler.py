        An allocation defines a timerange which can be reserved. No
        reservations can exist outside of existing allocations. In fact any
        reserved slot will link to an allocation.

        :dates:
            The datetimes to allocate. This can be a tuple with start datetime
            and an end datetime object, or a list of tuples with start and end
            datetime objects.

            If the datetime objects are timezone naive they are assumed to be
            of the same timezone as the scheduler itself.

        :partly_available:
            If an allocation is partly available, parts of its daterange may be
            reserved. So if the allocation lats from 01:00 to 03:00, a
            reservation may be made from 01:00 to 02:00.

            if partly_available if False, it may only be reserved as a whole
            (so from 01:00 to 03:00 in the aforementioned example).

            If partly_available is True, a raster may be specified. See
            ``raster``.

        :raster:
            If an allocation is partly available a raster defines the
            granularity with which a reservation can be made.

            For example: a raster of 15min will ensure that reservations are at
            least 15 minutes long and start either at :00, :15, :30 or :45).

            By default, we use a raster of 5, which means that reservations
            may not be shorter than 5 minutes and will snap to 00:05, 00:10,
            00:15 and so on.

            For performance reasons it is not possible to create reservations
            shorter than 5 minutes. If you need that, this library is not for
            you.

        :whole_day:
            If true, the hours/minutes of the given dates are ignored and they
            are made to span a whole day (relative to the scheduler's
            timezone).

        :quota:
            The number of times this allocation may be 'over-reserved'. Say you
            have a concert and you are selling 20 tickets. The concert is on
            saturday night, so there's only one start and end date. But there
            are 20 reservations/tickets that can be made on that allocation.

            By default, an allocation has a quota of one and may therefore
            only be reserved once.

        :quota_limit:
            The number of times a reservation may 'over-reserve' this
            allocation. If you are selling tickets for a concert and set the
            quota_limit to 2, then you are saying that each customer may only
            acquire 2 tickets at once.

            If the quota_limit is 0, there is no limit, which is the default.

        :grouped:
            Creates a grouped allocation. A grouped allocation is an allocation
            spanning multiple date-ranges that may only be reserved as a whole.

            An example for this is a college class which is scheduled to be
            given every tuesday afternoon. A student may either reserve a
            spot for the class as a whole (including all tuesday afternoons),
            or not at all.

            If the allocation has only one start and one end date, the grouped
            parameter has no effect.

            If allocate is called with multiple dates, without grouping, then
            every created allocation is completely independent.

            By default, allocations are not grouped.

        :data:
            A dictionary of your own chosing that will be attached to the
            allocation. Use this for your own data. Note that the dictionary
            needs to be json serializable.

            For more information see :ref:`custom-json`.

        :approve_manually:
            If true, reservations must be approved before they generate
            reserved slots. This allows for a kind fo waitinglist/queue
            that forms around an allocation, giving an admin the possiblity
            to pick the reservations he or she approves of.

            If false, reservations trigger a reserved slots immediatly, which
            results in a first-come-first-serve kind of thing.

            Manual approval is a bit of an anachronism in Libres which **might
            be removed in the future**. We strongly encourage you to not
            use this feature and to just keep the default (which is False).

        that emerge when reservations are removed:

        Initial State:
        1   (master)    Free
        2   (mirror)    Free
        3   (mirror)    Free

        2   (mirror)    Reserved
        3   (mirror)    Reserved

        A reservation is deleted:
        1   (master)    Reserved
        2   (mirror)    Free     <-- !!
        3   (mirror)    Reserved

        2   (mirror)    Reserved <-- !!

        In other words, the reserved allocations are moved to the beginning,
        the free allocations moved at the end. This is done to ensure that
        the sequence of generated uuids for the mirrors always represent all

        3   (mirror)    Reserved

        to be passed to :meth:`approve_reservations` to complete the
        reservation.

        That is to say, Libres uses a two-step reservation process. The first
        step is reserving what is either an open spot or a place on the
        waiting list (see ``approve_manually`` of
        :meth:`~libres.db.scheduler.Scheduler.allocate`).

        The second step is to actually write out the reserved slots, which
        is done by approving an existing reservation.

        Most checks are done in the reserve functions. The approval step
        only fails if there's no open spot.

        This function returns a reservation token which can be used to
        approve the reservation in approve_reservation.

        Usually you want to just short-circuit those two steps::

            scheduler.approve_reservations(
                scheduler.reserve(dates)
            )

        :email:
            Each reservation *must* be associated with an email. That is, a
            user.

        :dates:
            The dates to reserve. May either be a tuple of start/end datetimes
            or a list of such tuples.

        :group:
            The allocation group to reserve. ``dates``and ``group`` are
            mutually exclusive.

        :data:
            A dictionary of your own chosing that will be attached to the
            reservation. Use this for your own data. Note that the dictionary
            needs to be json serializable.

            For more information see :ref:`custom-json`.

        :session_id:
            An uuid that connects the reservation to a browser session.

            Together with
            :meth:`libres.db.queries.Queries.confirm_reservations_for_session`
            this can be used to create a reservation shopping card.

            By default the session_id is None, meaning that no browser session
            is associated with the reservation.

        :quota:
            The number of allocations that should be reserved at once. See
            ``quota`` in :meth:`~libres.db.scheduler.Scheduler.allocate`.
